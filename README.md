# VUJUnitExamples
This is an Eclipse project. 

Main example class is test/foodCartTest
(while showing need to comment statemnets to get all of the tests to pass and change class behaviour)

in test classes there are TODO statements, that explain what test need to be written.
Some excercises require that also the tested class code is updated!
